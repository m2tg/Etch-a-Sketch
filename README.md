Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

    - Rather than a simple color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the squareâ€™s RGB value entirely.

    - Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely    black square only after ten interactions.
